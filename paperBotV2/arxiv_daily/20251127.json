    "ori_summary": "Reranking improves recommendation quality by modeling item interactions. However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss. Deployed in Meituan advertising system, RIA yields a +1.69% improvement in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and a +4.54% increase in Cost Per Mille (CPM) in online A/B tests.",

To address this, inspired by Feature Integration Theory (FIT), we propose FITRep, the first attention-guided, white-box item representation framework for fine-grained item deduplication. FITRep consists of: (1) Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction (CHIE), using MLLMs to extract hierarchical semantic concepts; (2) Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction (SPDR), an adaptive UMAP-based method for efficient information compression; and (3) FAISS-Based Clustering (FBC), a FAISS-based clustering that assigns each item a unique cluster id using FAISS.

    "ori_summary": "Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment. We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking. VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.",

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.",

Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.",

We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.",

G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.",

Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer.

We present \\textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.",

Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech.

We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning.

For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.",

    "ori_summary": "Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.",

However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.",

Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.",

Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.",

We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected \"thoughts\" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting \"thoughts\" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether \"training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences.\" We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.",

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.",

To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.",

This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity.

Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window.

A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing.

While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.",

    "ori_summary": "Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.",

    "ori_summary": "Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., \"shape\", \"color\"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

    "ori_summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.",

We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography (\"data\", \"poop\", \"loll\": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.",

    "ori_summary": "Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.",

Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest.

This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.",

In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.",

    "ori_summary": "Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.",

    "ori_summary": "Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.",

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.",

While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D \"trace-space\" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.",

We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, \"how you move\" can indeed reveal \"what you are doing\" (egocentric) or \"observing\" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.",

To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.",

Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.",

However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.",

Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges.

Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead.

Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count.

    "ori_summary": "We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.",

To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.",

Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce).

We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods.

    "ori_summary": "Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.",

Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data.

This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.",

Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.",

Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

    "ori_summary": "We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored.

In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.",

However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.",

    "ori_summary": "3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.",

Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes.

While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.",

However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch.

In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description.

The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.",

    "ori_summary": "Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.",

However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.",

We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.",

State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art.

Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models.

However, despite their efficiency, these models often exhibit unstable prosody, speaker drift, and degraded naturalness. To address these issues, we propose a multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that directly optimizes the token generation policy of single-codebook TTS LLMs. Beyond standard intelligibility and speaker similarity objectives, our design integrates three rule-based rewards: a length penalty for duration consistency, an entropy regularization reward for decoding stability, and an LLM-annotated prosody alignment reward that explicitly supervises rhythm. In this prosody reward, an external reasoning LLM predicts multiple plausible pause structures via in-context learning, providing a human-preference-aligned supervisory signal for GRPO training. To assess universality, we further attach a flow-matching (FM) decoder on top of the GRPO-optimized AR backbone and observe consistent additional gains, indicating that our reinforcement optimization enhances the intrinsic AR policy. We further conduct a scalability analysis across data sizes and model scales, revealing that the proposed method consistently enhances prosodic stability, speaker similarity, and overall speech naturalness in single-codebook TTS LLMs.",

However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.",

Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.",

Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\\mathbb{C}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax.

Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries.

However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "ori_summary": "Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.",

However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\\times$.

The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.",

While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.",

Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically.

The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "ori_summary": "It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image\" to network extracted ``feature\", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.",

Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation. However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations. We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.",

    "ori_summary": "Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.",

As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\\% to 16\\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\\% to 21. 25\\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.",

However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \\textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.",

Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.",

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye",

However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.",

To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process.

The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models.

The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.",

Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.",

Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains.

However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.",

Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.",

Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.",

Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.",

This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning.

On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods.
