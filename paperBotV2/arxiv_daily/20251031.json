The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall.",

    "ori_summary": "Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging. WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation tasks.",

Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in noisy nodes.

Legal case documents offer rich factual and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction.

We propose LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures.

This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM) driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance further.",

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks, GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.",

Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another, mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.

However, these efforts typically proceed on separate tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans, a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.",

This paper introduces the Open Recommendation Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models. ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard. Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco, featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages. ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12 representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets, with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations.

Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model architecture or learning algorithm.

To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing agent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%.

Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%. Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models. https://amo-bench.github.io/",

    "ori_summary": "In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task. From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations. Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation, as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization to improve model alignment to human values.",

In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly \"end-to-end\" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass. Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from \"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method. Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g., \"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding.",

At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical delta rule. We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths. To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model checkpoints.",

Specifically, Evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7% improvement in accuracy.

To fill this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM).

Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while enjoying substantially better inference efficiency.

    "ori_summary": "This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

    "ori_summary": "Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches have significantly advanced performance on this task. In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set, conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the input's vector representation. Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities. These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.",

    "ori_summary": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM. Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool. Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were tested for rating the performance of the triage tool. Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78). The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76). Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3 Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522 (0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05). Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.",

However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation. Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database. The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change. DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling 1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty.

    "ori_summary": "Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well. Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering, provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.",

However, these models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune, require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs, underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.",

    "ori_summary": "Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations, this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew effect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

Code review serves as an effective practice that enables developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase. To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored. Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.",

In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement. During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.",

Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and 20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education. Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro surpassed 60\\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\\%.

In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method constructs a \"language model graph\" that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manually-curated teams based on known model specializations.

To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content and cognitive dimensions. Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points, while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs.",

However, real-world deployment faces three key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.",

We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics to assess performance across different task types.

These findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs' architectures.",

However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1) external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics; (2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.",

However, current watermarking solutions hardly resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of `correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom, covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in practice.",

Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\\% higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks.

We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans. Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition) that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding.

Current RAG evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG -- which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10 most cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks, with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model, GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1, validating the effectiveness of our method.",

We introduce What's In My Human Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders. WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7 datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer, and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them. WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance. They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that improve preference prediction.

We identify and formally characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps, erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0). Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

    "ori_summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple \"attention heads.\" Extensive experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens, further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition, real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.",

Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%.

Stage 1 performs a brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic, requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks. Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning curriculum yields consistent gains.

Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10 different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation, Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of effective communication.",

    "ori_summary": "While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common \"one problem, one solution\" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we propose a \"one problem, multiple solutions\" (1PNS) training paradigm that exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16 over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that 1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.

This task can be viewed as a language generation task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic. However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3 reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written codes (39.98%).

However, its effect on model's robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing'' capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale. Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better debiasing methods.",

Their prevalence, features, and clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9% women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small, low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective follow-up.",

Existing video-to-4D methods typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines, advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.",

Standard image retrieval techniques are inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas spanning multiple countries.

Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability.

    "ori_summary": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

    "ori_summary": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this paper, we introduce a novel \"ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)\" to provide a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases, weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened in current models.",

While optical flow, a computer vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images, has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion, which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations, offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.",

    "ori_summary": "We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches, specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the properties of event cameras.",

    "ori_summary": "Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution, intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained, large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural monitoring.",

    "ori_summary": "Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here, we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4 diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results, demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases, enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

Emu3.5 is pre-trained end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA), which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction, accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance. Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks.

    "ori_summary": "Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However, their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains.",

The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors. Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic fusion of vision and language.

This study presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net, YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows in ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over Vicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building on these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and robust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing, Mask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while YOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The estimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters, reflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate Mask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas YOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net remains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate, scalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM integration and field calibration for operational decision support.",

    "ori_summary": "Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI), plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly, the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions, which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network (SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal image analysis.

This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set.

To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores. Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing a new zero-shot state of the art.

Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images. However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance, which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.",

We propose to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\\% occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\\% for CoTracker2; and significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs 82.8).

However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability, trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably, our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM calibration during test-time adaptation.

To address these gaps, we propose LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation (LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos, LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating elements like scene transitions and event dynamics.

Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc. Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical directions for future method improvement.",

To address this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.",

    "ori_summary": "Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis. While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

While this approach has advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS, a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted probabilities and reliabilities.

Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor.

    "ori_summary": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion (PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters, overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result, scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen. Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR) while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.",

To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer (ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them (\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability for feature fusion and decision-making.",

Our benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and $16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to $300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital dynamics and resource constraints.

A dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution for AEOS constellation scheduling.

Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules.

Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks, which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and detail quality.",

Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach leveraging a \"learn from synthesis\" strategy. First, a diffusion model is trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.",

Yet, systematically identifying these biases is challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models. ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures, backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions. ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model diagnostics.",

Researchers have investigated various methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.",

To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks: single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for improvement.

In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation, rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto (pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of 1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse traffic scenarios.

However, acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need for actual radiology reports.",

To meet diverse application demands, we instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference speed.

Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space, each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution, enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part generation.",

Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.

Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance.

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.

Our approach iteratively refines 3D Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle.

To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information.

OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o).

    "ori_summary": "Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks, especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content. Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of PReMA.",

    "ori_summary": "We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment.",

    "ori_summary": "Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound (US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL) framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.",
